- How to execute `kopano-cli --list-users` and `kopano-storeadm -h default: -P` after kopano-server has been started?
  - `--list-users` should be run in regular intervals
  - `kopano-storeadm` just needs to be run after startup, multiple executions do not harm
- ssl config for ical and gateway
- ldap indices
- Won't fix: Kopano 8.6.x dagent won't start because of an incompatible configuration. A fix for this should be only present in a dedicated branch
